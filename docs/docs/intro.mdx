<h1>A beautiful and flexible UI framework for Flutter</h1>
<span>Built as an alternative to Material and Cupertino</span>
</div>

## Mission

> Jolt's primary purpose is to provide an alternative to Material/Cupertino when building Flutter apps.

> It aims to be more flexible, more composable and enhance the developer experience.

### Flexible
Theming in has been rebuilt from the ground up, but in a way that should feel familiar for Flutter developers. There are no options locked away because "it doesn't fit the spec" and it is super easy to extend the defaults.

### Composable
Jolt introduces two new important widgets: **Interaction** and **Surface**. These widgets form the basis of many widgets such as Buttons and FormFields. The reason this is significant is that it is much easier to compose your own custom widgets using these building blocks.

### Developer experience
Jolt provides a huge range of optional extensions to make life easier. You can access your colors, typography and much more from the build context. Optional syntax is also provided for a SwiftUI-like way of working.

### More features
- Redesigned Scaffold (accompanied by Shell), is better suited to cross platform development and is far more flexible.
- Theme, scaling and locale management.
- More flexible overlays (Snackbars, dialogs, etc).
- Pre-bundled with **[Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/)** instead of Material Icons.
<!-- TODO Much more to go here I think -->
