<h1>A beautiful and flexible UI framework for Flutter</h1>
<span>Built as an alternative to Material and Cupertino</span>
</div>

## Mission

> Jolt's primary purpose is to provide an alternative to Material/Cupertino when building Flutter apps.

> It aims to improve flexibility, composability and the developer experience.

### Flexible
Theming has been rebuilt from the ground up, but in a way that should feel familiar for Flutter developers. There are no options locked away because "it doesn't fit the spec" and it is super easy to extend the defaults.

### Composable
Jolt introduces two new important widgets: **Interaction** and **Surface**. These widgets form the basis of many widgets such as Buttons and FormFields. The reason this is significant is that it is much easier to compose your own custom widgets using these building blocks.

### Developer experience
Jolt provides a huge range of optional extensions to make life easier. You can access your colors, typography and much more from the build context. Optional syntax is also provided for a SwiftUI-like way of working.

### More features
- Redesigned Scaffold (accompanied by Shell), is better suited to cross platform development and is far more flexible.
- Theme, scaling and locale management.
- More flexible overlays (Snackbars, dialogs, etc).
- Pre-bundled with **[Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/)** instead of Material Icons.

### Disclaimer

- Jolt is not Material and as such is not built to the Material 3 specification.
- Jolt is not production ready (yet).
- Jolt is not a fully complete alternative to Material (yet).

### Acknowledgements

#### Icons

> Jolt comes bundled with **[Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/)**, check them out.

#### Forms 

> Jolt's form implementation was inspired by [flutter_form_builder](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_form_builder).
> Jolt also comes bundled with **[form_builder_validators](https://pub.dev/packages/form_builder_validators)**.

#### Extension syntax
> Jolt supports some [extension based syntax](/developer_experience/extension_syntax) for a more SwiftUI-like way of working. This is entirely optional and is not required to use Jolt.
> This syntax was inspired by [@luke_pighetti](https://twitter.com/luke_pighetti) and [flutter_animate](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_animate)

#### Jolt is heavily inspired by other UI frameworks, thank you to the following projects:
> - **[Material Design](https://m3.material.io/)**
> - **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**
