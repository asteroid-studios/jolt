# Theming

Themes have been simplifed to only include the following:
- A color scheme
- Dimensions (Spacing, border radius, etc)
- Typography

The reason for this is that in most use cases, the only things that change between themes are these properties.

Jolt still allows you to define base styles for all your widgets, but this is done in the [WidgetTheme](./theming/widget-theme).

## Setting up themes

```dart
final app = JoltApp(
  themes: themes, // Pass your themes to the Jolt App
  widgetTheme: widgetTheme, 
  routerConfig: _appRouter.config(),
);

final themes = [
  Theme(
    id: 'default_light',
    colorScheme: ColorScheme.light(),
    typography: typography,
    // Dimensions come with sensible defaults so you probably don't need to change them
    // dimensions: Dimensions(),
  ),
  Theme(
    id: 'default_dark',
    colorScheme: ColorScheme.dark(),
    typography: typography,
  ),
];
```

## Theme management

Theme management is provided out of the box, using Hive to persist the theme between sessions.

Setting a theme is broken up into two possible choices:
- Changing the primary color.
- Changing the theme mode (light/dark/system).

The reason this was done was to support the use case where you want to change the primary color of your app, but keep the theme mode the same.

When you change from light to dark mode, Jolt will find the dark theme with the same primary color as the light theme you were using.

```dart
// Switch between light dark and system themes
Button(
  icon: Icons.sun,
  onTap: () => context.jolt.setTheme(ThemeMode.light),
),
Button(
  icon: Icons.moon,
  onTap: () => context.jolt.setTheme(ThemeMode.dark),
),
Button(
  icon: Icons.gear,
  onTap: () => context.jolt.setTheme(ThemeMode.system),
),

// Change the primary color
Button(
  background: Colors.violet,
  onTap: ()=> context.jolt.setPrimaryColor(Colors.violet),
),
```
