Jolt is a UI framework for Flutter that aims to provide a flexible, composable and responsive set of widgets that can be used to build apps that look and feel great on any platform.

## Goals

<Steps> 

### Composable

The expectation is that if a developer digs into a provided widget, they should be able to easily understand how it works and extract their own version.

For example: A default **Button** widget is provided but internally it's just a composition of a **Surface** and **Interaction** widget.

``` dart filename="Some clickable text with padding that expands on hover" {2,6}
Interaction(
  onTap: () => print('Do something'),
  builder: (context, state) {
    return Surface(
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(
        state.isHovering ? context.spacing.md : context.spacing.sm
      ),
      child: Text('Click me'),
    );
  }
)
```


### Flexible

Rather than try to force users into a specific design spec, the goal is to provide sensible defaults and allow apps to develop their own identity.

You can override the default style of any widget, either at the widget level or globally in the widget theme.

``` dart filename="An example widget theme"
WidgetTheme widgetTheme(BuildContext context) {
  return WidgetTheme(
    surfaceStyle: SurfaceStyle(
      // Make the border radius of every surface large
      borderRadius: context.borderRadius.lg,
    ),
  );
}
```

### Responsive

Making responsive designs should be easy, allowing tweaks to be made at any level of the widget tree to adapt to different screen sizes.

The **Shell** and **Scaffold** widgets make up the base of the responsive functionality, but you can use the **context.responsive** method to make micro-adjustments anywhere.

``` dart filename="Some responsive text" {3-5}
Text(
  'Some text',
  style: context.responsive(
    desktop: context.style.hero, // On desktop and above use the hero style
  ) ?? context.style.heading, // Default to heading
)
```

### Developer Friendly

Jolt aims to be magic when your needs are simple but flexible when they're not.

A lot of thought was put in to naming conventions and how to make the API as intuitive as possible.

``` dart filename="A basic button" {4-6}
Button(
  label: 'Delete Account',
  icon: Icons.trash,
  // You could achieve the same styling inline - instead of using extensions
  // background: context.color.error,
  // style: context.style.label,
)
.withBackgroundError()
.withStyleLabel(),
```
