## A powerful UI library for Flutter.

Everything you need to create beautiful interfaces that look great on any platform. Highly flexible, easy to theme and creating custom widgets is a breeze.

Check out the examples below or flick through the [example code](https://github.com/asteroid-studios/jolt/tree/master/apps/example).

<Cards>
  <ExternalLink child={<Card  icon={<Globe weight="duotone" size='32' />}  title="Web" href="https://example.flutterjolt.dev/"/>} href="https://example.flutterjolt.dev/"/>
  <Card icon={<AppStoreLogo weight="duotone" size='32' />}  title="iOS" href="https://example.flutterjolt.dev/" />
  <Card icon={<GooglePlayLogo weight="duotone" size='32' />}  title="Android" href="https://example.flutterjolt.dev/" />
</Cards>

## Goals

<Steps> 

### Favour composition

We've all been told, **everything is a widget**.

By combining powerful basic widgets like **Surface** and **Interaction**, you can create maintainable custom widgets easily.


- Check out the [widget catalogue](https://example.flutterjolt.dev/) for basics, form-fields, and much more.
- See the guide on [creating reusable widgets](https://example.flutterjolt.dev/).


{/* TODO use a better example */}
``` dart filename="Some clickable text with padding that expands on hover" {2,6}
Interaction(
  onTap: () => print('Do something'),
  builder: (context, state) {
    return Surface(
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(
        state.isHovering ? context.spacing.md : context.spacing.sm
      ),
      child: Text('Click me'),
    );
  }
)
```


### Stay flexible

Libraries like Material and Cupertino are fantastic tools but they can be very rigid by design.

With Jolt, a lot of effort has been made to ensure anything that could be configurable, is configurable.

- Every widget has a corresponding **Style** class. This class defines all the configurable properties available.
- The system is designed to allow maximum maintainability, with a clearly defined [hierarchy](https://example.flutterjolt.dev/).


``` dart filename="Theming example"

```

### Prioritise accessibility

When building quickly, we sometimes forget to put labels on buttons or to make sure the text has enough contrast.
 
You can save your users from squinting by making accessibility easy.

- Semantic properties are readily available for all widgets including the new **identifier** property to make testing a breeze.
- Jolt has a few tricks with colors to ensure text and backgrounds are always visible and clear.

``` dart filename="Accessibility example" {3-5}

```

### Look great everywhere

Flutter just about anywhere and between platform differences and screen sizes, responsive design is hard.

Jolt can ease the burden with clever layout widgets and helpful responsive utilities.

- Set your breakpoints and use the **Shell** and **Scaffold** widgets to make use of the space available on each platform with ease.
- When you need to make micro-adjustments, use the **context.responsive** method to make changes at any level of the widget tree.

``` dart filename="Responsive example" {3-5}

```

### Move quickly with precision

Building an MVP on the weekend? <br/>Or maybe implementing a large scale app based on a strict design system?

You should be able to do both with the same library.

- When you need to build quickly, Jolt uses sensible defaults that result in a great looking app with minimal effort.
- When you need control over every shade and every pixel, you can do that too.


{/* TODO example of automatic colors vs tightly defined */}
``` dart filename="Quick vs thorough theming" {4-6}

```

## Roadmap

This project is in an early alpha stage. Check the [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/asteroid-studios/projects/3) to see what's coming next.

<Callout emoji={<Siren weight="duotone" size='28' />} type="warning">
  **Business beware** <br/> This project is neither production ready nor a fully complete alternative to Material/Cupertino **(yet)**. <br/>Keep a close eye on the project and hope to see you soon!

## Shout-outs
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), Jolt provides the Tailwind colors as defaults in the **Color** class.
- [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/), the icon package used in the examples and the documentation
- [form_builder_validators](https://pub.dev/packages/form_builder_validators), comes packaged with Jolt for convenience.
