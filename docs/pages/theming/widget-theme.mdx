# Widget Theme

When working with Material in Flutter, the **ThemeData** class contains the styling for not only your colors and typography, but every Material widget as well.

This doesn't make a heap of sense because it's very common to have multiple color schemes in an app, but generally your buttons and form widgets would have a consistent feel.

Jolt simplifies this by getting you to define a **WidgetTheme** separate to your themes.

## Setup

```dart {3}
final app = JoltApp(
  themes: themes,
  widgetTheme: widgetTheme, // Pass your widgetTheme method to the Jolt App
  routerConfig: _appRouter.config(),
);

// Your widget theme method has access to a build context
// This allows you to access values from the active theme
WidgetTheme widgetTheme(BuildContext context) {
  return WidgetTheme(
    // Define a base surface style for all widgets
    surfaceStyle: SurfaceStyle(
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(context.spacing.md),
    ),
    // Define a style for all buttons
    buttonStyle: (type) => ButtonStyle(
      labelStyle: context.style.body.copyWith(
        fontWeight: FontWeight.w600,
      ),
      // Override the surface style of individual widgets
      surfaceStyle: SurfaceStyle(
        borderRadius: context.borderRadius.xl,
        padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(
          vertical: context.spacing.xs,
          // You can change the values based on the button type.
          // For example you can enforce icon buttons to be square 
          horizontal: type == ButtonType.icon || type == ButtonType.empty
              ? context.spacing.xs
              : context.spacing.md,
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```
