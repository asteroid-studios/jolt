Best practice for managing Jolt in your Flutter project, is to keep all your UI components installed from Jolt in a standalone package within your project.

From the root of your Flutter project, run the following command:

```sh
jolt init
```

This will create a new ui folder, which will be your Jolt package. Any Jolt widgets you install will be created within that folder.

<Tabs.Tab>

To create a new Flutter project using the Jolt CLI, you can use the create command.

```sh
jolt create my_app
```

A new project will be created with the following optional features:

- Routing
- Localization
- State management with Riverpod
- Themes
