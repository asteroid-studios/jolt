## Getting started

Before you rush off to make your first PR, please have a quick read through the docs about the conventions and goals set out for the project.

There is information about why/how Jolt differs from Material, as well as file structure, comments and testing.

## The basics

### Linting

The linting of choice is currently [very_good_analysis](https://pub.dev/packages/very_good_analysis). Please make sure that any PRs are submitted with no linting errors.

### Comments

As part of the linting, you might see `Missing documentation for a public member`. 

All public members should have sensible comments, for example:

``` dart
/// Providing a tooltip to [Button] will enable a tooltip to show on hover or long press.
///
/// It will also add the tooltip to the semantic widget for accessibility.
final String tooltip;
```


### Testing

TBD


```dart
Button(style: myVarient)

```
