# About

## What's Jolt?

Jolt is a UI library for Flutter intended to be a more flexible and modern alternative to Material and Cupertino.

## Where it's at?

This is a massive project and I'm working on it in my spare time, so it's going to take a while to get to a point where it's stable. But I'm making progress regularly and you can follow the [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/asteroid-studios/projects/3) here.

## The team

Right now, Jolt is just [me](https://twitter.com/kane_wickman), but I am accepting expressions of interest for co-maintainers.

## Why go to all the effort?

I love Flutter but I'm also highly design focused. Eventually I got tired of trying to make Material not look like Material.
