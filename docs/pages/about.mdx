# About

## What is Jolt?

Jolt is a UI Framework for Flutter intended to be a more flexible alternative to Material and Cupertino. It's designed to look great out of the box and easily allow customization to match your apps identity.

## Where it's at

This is a massive project and I'm working on it in my spare time, so it's going to take a while to get to a point where it's stable. But I'm making progress every week and you can follow the [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/asteroid-studios/projects/3) here.

## The team

Right now, Jolt is just [me](https://twitter.com/kane_wickman), but I am accepting expressions of interest for co-maintainers.

## Why go to all the effort?

At all the companies I've worked at and in my personal projects, I found myself making UI packages to maintain an abstraction of Material UI to get it to play nice.

Eventually I decided to ditch Material completely and that's when this version of Jolt was born. There are so many cool things I couldn't do using MaterialApp and switching to JoltApp (using WidgetsApp under the hood) opened a lot of doors.
